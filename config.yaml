    title: About Me
    icon: fas fa-user
    description: |1-
      - I'm currently a student at the University of Texas at Dallas studying Computer Information Systems and Technology, with a focus in enterprise systems.
      - I have a variety of work experiences, primarily associated with non-profit religious organizations, but I've also taken on many personal projects, such as this blog, to expand my skills and learn new ways of using technology.
      - I started running my own mini-server back in 2022 when I wanted to get away from some of the nonsense and politics with services like Spotify and Apple Music. I started hosting an application called Navidrome, which acts as a personal Spotify for music I buy and own. Since then, I have gradually grown the number of applications I run on my old 2017 i7-7500u Acer laptop. This learning experience has been instrumental to preparing me for a future within the CISTech world, and it's something I've enjoyed doing since I started learning about it.
      - The purpose of this blog is to share my experiences going through college, lessons I learned, or random thoughts that I want to share with the world! Think of this like a healthier social media for me, where I can make posts, but without the downside of doom-scrolling right before an important test.
      - Additionally, I am a bit of an armature when it comes to writing, but hopefully this blog will help me to further develop my writing skills too! Either way, I hope you find my thoughts useful and insightful into the world I live in! Thanks for reading!
